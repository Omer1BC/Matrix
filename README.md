# Instructions
## Running the Backend
The backend is fully containerized and runs on ```localhost:8000/```. Spin up by making sure you're withing the ```/Matrix``` root directory and run ```docker compose up backend```. You may need to install docker desktop and have it running if you encounter an error running ```docker <cmnd>```

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Endpoints can be found at ```/Matrix/backend/api/urls.py``` which reference methods written in ```/Matrix/backend/api/views.py```. ```/backend/media``` stores the static video content which is generated by manim. To use the AI hints feature, paste your openAI key at ```/backend/utils/.env```.

## Running the Frontend
Navigate to ```/Matrix/frontend``` and run ```npm run dev``` which will start on ```localhost:3000/```. You may need to run ```npm install``` to load all dependencies form the .json files. ```frontend/.next``` and  ```frontend/.node_modules``` are hidden by gitignore so they will not show on the repo.  

```localhost:3000/solve``` is the most developed page which corrosponds ```/frontend/src/app/solve/page.js```. Routing is done by creating a directory and having a ```page.js``` file under it. The home page is found at ```frontend/page.js```which links other pages.

### /solve Layout
```/solve/page.js``` is compose of 4 cards whose template is found at ```/src/app/templates/cards```. The 4 sections are named content for the video section (top left), references (bottom left), code (top right), and validation (bottom right). Each card is passed key, value pairs specify the name of the tab and the content (other components) to render for each tab. The code editor is provided by react, and hints can be tested for the twoSum problem with an api key. Expected solution is found at ```/backend/media/1_2sum.py```. The test button will append to the file the current code and run the tests.
